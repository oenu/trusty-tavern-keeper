        All you need to do is sign up with your Discord account and join a
        group. You will then be asked to fill out a short and anonymous survey
        where you can select your preferences and boundaries for each game. Your
        DM will also fill out the survey and get a report with the group's
        aggregated results. The report will show the content and roleplay
        options that are most popular, most controversial, and most avoided by
        the group. It will also provide suggestions for the DM on how to create
        a game that everyone will enjoy.
